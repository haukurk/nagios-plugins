#### Nagios Related Plugins ####
This repositoty is for useful Nagios plug-ins that I've been working on over the years. Also I include some plug-ins that are not officially released.

#### Installation ####
These have only been tested on Centos 6.5 or AIX, depending on which OS the plugin is made for.

Each plugin includes a installation script which you can just run:
```
cd plugin-name
sh install.sh
```

#### List of plugins ####

* AIX filesystem checks
* Yum Checks
